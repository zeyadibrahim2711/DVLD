## 📌 Overview

A full-featured Desktop System that simulates a real-world Driving & Vehicle Licensing Department workflow.

The system manages people, users, driving license applications, testing processes, license issuance, renewals, replacements, and detention operations with structured business rules and layered architecture.

This project demonstrates real backend logic implementation beyond basic CRUD operations.
